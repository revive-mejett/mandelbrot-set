# Mandelbrot Set Simulation
![Full fractal](https://github.com/revive-mejett/mandelbrot-set/assets/90886544/a186e54e-1c58-4ebd-be68-473d88d23ce1)

## Overview
This project is a simulation of a famous fractal known as the `Mandelbrot set`. In short, it is a picture generated by a mathematical equation
and complex numbers and the points are coloured in a 2d plane depending on how fast a resulting number grows after succesive iterations.

## Features

1. `üîéZoom-in`: Zoom in/out where you can zoom deep into the fractal until the precision limit of floating numbers in JS.
2. `‚ÜîÔ∏è Panning`: You can click on a journal entry and view the entire entry, and all the keyword tags the entry has.
3. `Toolbar and controls`: You can see the coordinates you are at in the zoom, a controls "tutorial" and some settings
4. `Iteration and zoom settings`: You can set the zoom multiplier, pan amount, and max iterations* (see 5)
5. `Max iterations`: You can increase/decrease max iterations to change the resolution of the image (note better resolution with greater max iterations = more time required to calculate)

## Languages/Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Libraries used:
- None (Vanilla JS)
