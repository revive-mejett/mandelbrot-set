# mandelbrot-set

## Overview
This project is a simulation of a famous fractal known as the `Mandelbrot set`. In short, it is a picture generated by a mathematical equation
and complex numbers and the points are coloured in a 2d plane depending on how fast a resulting number grows after succesive iterations.

## Features
<ul>
  <li>Zoom in/out where you can zoom deep into the fractal until the precision limit of floating numbers in JS.</li>
  <li>Panning to pan the view</li>
